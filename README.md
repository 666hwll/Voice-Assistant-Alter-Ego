# Voice-Assistant-Pyaudio-Alpha-0.1:
Simple but experimental Implementation of a digital Assistant;
The Projekt startet on the 20th February 2023 = True:
While True:
  My Goals are:
    if work_in_progress == True:
      #to create an voice assistant which also supports keyboard input and screen output;
      #to have unix/linux support and Windows NT;
      #to make it that minimal that every toaster could run this program;
      #to use json-files for persistance-data, the program should check if it is readable when it is starting;
      #when the json is not functional, it should create a new one with new values, it should ask the user for details; 
      #compile the program with pyinstaller or cython;
      #it should use ctypes(
      #it should write preferences into the json, eg. the search engine the user wants;
      #should run as a system command on unix/linux or have at least support.
    elif main_goals = done:
      #create a gui for all my assistants;
      #continue with my other voice assistants;
      #upload the code on github and make a website for it;
      #executables for MacOS X, Windows NT and Linux-like systems(debian, arch, fedora, alpine, alma, ubuntu, android ...) and Unix(BSD and Solaris) and for Risc OS.
